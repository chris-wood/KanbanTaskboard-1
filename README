The goal for the Kanban Taskboard is to provide software development teams with a tool that allows for more transparency towards project requirements, tasks, and milestones. Kanban is an agile methodology for visualizing, managing and optimizing the flow of software requirements for a given application and for distributing the associated work among the development team. This application can be synchronized between multiple platforms.
